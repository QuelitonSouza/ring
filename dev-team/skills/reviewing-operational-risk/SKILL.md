description: "Reviewing a C#/.NET service's operational risk by mapping integration failure points (external HttpClient calls, queue/message consumers, outbound webhooks), simulating stuck intermediate states for each entity in a flow, and classifying each scenario into tiers — then emitting operational runbooks (Tier 2) or gap specs (Tier 3). Two entry modes: explore an existing codebase, or read a dev-cycle plan.md and epic artifacts. Use before production hardening, incident retros, or at dev-cycle end. Skip for prototypes, pure libraries, or when no integration boundaries exist."

# Operational Risk Review

## When to use
- Preparing a service for production and want to know what breaks when a flow gets stuck
- After a dev-cycle: pressure-test the newly built flows for recovery gaps
- Incident retro: formalize which failure modes have a rescue path and which do not
- You need operational runbooks or a backlog of "missing rescue mechanism" gap specs

## Skip when
- Prototype / throwaway PoC not heading to production
- Pure library or NuGet package with no integration boundaries (no external calls, queues, or webhooks)
- Single-question check (use a targeted read instead of the full review)

## Related
**Complementary:** ring:hardening-dockerfiles (container hardening), ring:implementing-readyz (readiness probes), ring:dev-cycle (optional end-of-cycle hook)

## What this produces
For every failure scenario, a **tier** and an actionable artifact:

| Tier | Meaning | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Tier 1** | The app resolves it itself — automatic retry, compensation, TTL/expiry, DLQ replay | Note only (documented as self-healing) |
| **Tier 2** | An **external trigger exists** that unblocks it — an API call, an endpoint, an admin/UI action | **Operational runbook** with concrete steps |
| **Tier 3** | **Gap** — no rescue path exists short of direct DB intervention | **Gap spec** (what's missing, who can act today, what should exist) |

## Audience
The output is always written **for the developer running the skill** (tech lead or engineer). Runbooks assume operator access; gap specs assume backlog ownership.

## Deployment context
Their .NET backends run BOTH on Kubernetes (AKS) AND on a VPS with Docker. Recovery paths differ per target:
- On **K8s**, a stuck pod may be recycled by liveness/readiness probes (see ring:implementing-readyz), but that does NOT unwind a half-committed business flow.
- On the **VPS (Docker Compose / plain Docker)**, there is no orchestrator to recycle anything — a stuck consumer stays stuck until an operator acts. Runbooks must state which deploy target they apply to.

---

## How this skill runs: a hybrid (mechanical + judgement) flow

The review is split into two phases so the deterministic work is not left to the LLM:

**Phase 1 — mechanical (`scan-integration-points.mjs`, run by the dev):**
A zero-dependency Node.js script traverses the target repo and finds integration
boundaries (external HTTP calls, queue consumers, event publishers, outbound
webhooks). For each point it heuristically records whether retry, DLQ, timeout,
rollback/compensation, and idempotency patterns appear nearby. It emits a
structured JSON report. It is generic and language-agnostic: it runs on any
C#/.NET, Go, or TypeScript/Node.js repo. This phase is repeatable and produces
the same map every time.

**Phase 2 — judgement (this agent, from here on):**
The agent takes the JSON as structured context, runs the confirmation dialogue,
simulates stuck states, classifies Tier 1/2/3, and writes runbooks (T2) and gap
specs (T3). This is the analysis that needs a human-in-the-loop and cannot be
reduced to regex.

> **The developer runs the `.mjs` first and pastes/attaches its JSON output to
> the agent before the dialogue begins.** In Mode A the agent uses that JSON as
> the boundary map instead of re-deriving it by hand. See **Step 1 (Mode A)**.

---

## Step 0: Determine entry mode

Ask the developer (or infer from context):

- **Mode A — Codebase explore:** review an existing service by scanning its integration boundaries.
- **Mode B — Plan context:** review flows just built in a dev-cycle by reading `plan.md` and the current cycle's epic artifacts, without exploring the whole repo.

If a `plan.md` (ring:write-plan format) with an active cycle is present and the developer wants to review *what was just built*, prefer **Mode B**. Otherwise use **Mode A**.

---

## Step 1 (Mode A): Map integration boundaries — run the scanner first

The boundary map is produced **mechanically** by the script, not by hand. The
developer runs it against the target repo and gives the JSON to the agent:

```bash
# From the target repo root (any C#/.NET, Go, or TS/Node.js service):
node /path/to/reviewing-operational-risk/scan-integration-points.mjs . --out ops-risk-scan.json
# then paste/attach ops-risk-scan.json to the agent before the dialogue.
```

> **Multi-project .NET solution — do NOT scan only the API project.** In a
> layered/Clean-Architecture .NET solution the outbound boundaries usually live
> in an `Infrastructure` project (typed `HttpClient` implementations, message-bus
> adapters, repositories), NOT under the Web/API project. Scanning only
> `src/MyApp.Api` returns a **false 0**. Always run from the **solution root**
> (where the `.sln` lives) so every `*.csproj` — `Infrastructure`, `Adapters`,
> `Messaging`, `Clients` — is included. When `integration_points == 0` for a
> service that clearly calls external systems, treat it as a scope error, not a
> clean bill of health, and re-run from the solution root.

The script emits `ring.ops-risk.integration-scan.v1` JSON. For .NET the
boundaries to expect:

```jsonc
{
  "scan_root": "/repo", "requested_target": "/repo/src/MyApp.Api",
  "warnings": [ { "level": "warn", "code": "zero_integration_points",
                 "message": "0 boundaries in a service that references an Http/Messaging client ..." } ],
  "summary": { "files_scanned": 210, "integration_points": 102, "by_category": {...} },
  "integration_points": [
    { "category": "http_outbound", "direction": "outbound",
      "file": "src/MyApp.Infrastructure/Clients/FeesClient.cs", "line": 42,
      "snippet": "await _httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync(...)",
      "resilience": { "retry": true, "dlq": false, "timeout": true,
                      "rollback": false, "idempotency": false } }
  ],
  "resilience_gaps": [ { "file": "...", "line": 42, "missing": ["dlq","rollback"] } ]
}
```

Always read `warnings[]` first: a `zero_integration_points` warning means the map
is probably incomplete (scope error) and must not be treated as "no boundaries
exist".

The agent consumes this JSON as the starting boundary map. **Treat every hit as
a candidate and every `false` resilience flag as a prompt to verify, not a
confirmed gap** — the regex scan is deterministic but heuristic. The focus stays
on what the service **expects to receive and how it reacts when it does not** —
do NOT leave the repo to inspect dependencies.

If the script cannot be run (no Node.js, restricted env), fall back to manual
greps for the same .NET boundaries — **run these from the solution root** so the
`Infrastructure`/`Adapters`/`Messaging` projects are covered, not just the API
project:

```bash
# Outbound HTTP (HttpClient, IHttpClientFactory, typed clients, Refit, RestSharp, Flurl)
grep -rn "HttpClient\|IHttpClientFactory\|PostAsJsonAsync\|GetAsync\|SendAsync\|RestClient\|FlurlRequest\|\[Get(\|\[Post(" --include=*.cs .

# Message/queue consumers (RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Kafka, MassTransit)
grep -rn "IConsumer<\|BasicConsume\|ServiceBusProcessor\|IConsume\|Subscribe(\|StartConsuming\|ProcessMessageAsync\|IHostedService\|BackgroundService" --include=*.cs .

# Event publishers / outbound webhooks
grep -rn "Publish(\|Send(\|BasicPublish\|SendMessageAsync\|IBus\|callbackUrl\|webhookUrl\|NotifyUrl" --include=*.cs .

# Resilience wrappers to correlate against (Polly, resilience pipelines)
grep -rn "Polly\|AddPolicyHandler\|ResiliencePipeline\|WaitAndRetry\|CircuitBreaker\|AddStandardResilienceHandler" --include=*.cs .
```

For **each** integration point, confirm the resilience posture (the script
pre-fills these flags; verify them against the code):

| Attribute | What to check (.NET) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Retry | Is there a Polly retry policy / `AddStandardResilienceHandler` (count, backoff)? |
| Rollback / compensation | On failure, is there a compensating action, saga step, or `TransactionScope`/outbox? |
| DLQ | Dead-letter queue or parking for un-processable messages (Service Bus DLQ, RabbitMQ DLX)? |
| Timeout handling | Explicit `CancellationToken` / `HttpClient.Timeout` + handling of the timeout path? |
| Idempotency | Safe to reprocess without duplicate side effects (idempotency key, dedupe table)? |

Produce a **boundary map**: `{integration_point, direction, entities_touched, resilience: {retry, rollback, dlq, timeout, idempotency}}`.

---

## Step 1 (Mode B): Extract the flow from the plan

Read the cycle's `plan.md` and the epic artifacts of the **current cycle** only:

- `## Phase Overview` + the active phase's `### Epic N.M:` sections → the flows built this cycle
- Each epic's task blocks → the entities created/mutated and the transitions between them
- Any linked design docs (data model, API contracts) referenced by the epics

Produce, per flow: `{flow_name, entry_point, entities[], state_transitions[], terminal_state}`. Do not scan the whole repo — the plan is the source.

---

## Step 2: Confirmation dialogue with the developer

Before analysing failures, confirm the model out loud and get agreement. In
Mode A, drive this dialogue **from the scanner JSON** — walk the developer
through the `integration_points` and the `resilience_gaps` the script surfaced,
and let them correct false positives/negatives before you classify anything:

```
For flow "<flow_name>":
  Entry point:      <e.g. POST /transfers>
  Terminal state:   <e.g. transfer.Status = Settled>
  Entities & states: <entity: [state1 → state2 → state3]>
  Dependencies:     <external calls / queues / webhooks identified>
  Deploy target:    <AKS / VPS Docker / both>

Is this correct? Anything missing or misidentified?
```

Incorporate corrections before proceeding. This gate prevents analysing a wrong model.

---

## Step 3: Simulate stuck intermediate states

For **each intermediate state** of **each entity** in the flow, simulate a failure of progression and trace downstream impact:

```
For entity E, transition Sn → Sn+1:
  1. Assume E is stuck in Sn (the transition never completes).
  2. What triggers Sn → Sn+1? (a consumer, an HTTP response, a hosted/background service, a user action)
  3. If that trigger never fires or fails:
     - What downstream entities/flows are blocked or left inconsistent?
     - Is there money / data / a user commitment left in limbo?
  4. What, if anything, moves E forward or unwinds it?
```

Record one **scenario** per stuck state.

---

## Step 4: Classify each scenario into a tier

| Tier | Test | Example (.NET) |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | A mechanism inside the app recovers it with no human trigger | Polly retry with backoff, saga compensation, Service Bus DLQ + auto-replay, expiry `BackgroundService` |
| **Tier 2** | A rescue path exists but needs an **external trigger** | re-drive endpoint, admin API, replay CLI, `dotnet` console tool, manual DLQ resubmit |
| **Tier 3** | No rescue path exists without touching the database directly | stuck row with no re-drive, orphaned record no API can fix |

Downgrade honestly: if the "retry" only works when the DB is hand-edited first, it's **Tier 3**, not Tier 2.

---

## Step 5: Emit outputs

Write to `docs/ops-risk/<flow-or-service>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

### Tier 2 → Operational runbook
```
### Runbook: <scenario>
Deploy target:  <AKS / VPS Docker / both>
Symptom:        <how an operator recognises the stuck state>
Detection:      <query / metric / log to confirm>
Trigger:        <the exact API call / endpoint / admin action that unblocks it>
Steps:          1. ... 2. ... 3. ...
Verification:   <how to confirm the entity reached terminal state>
Blast radius:   <what else is affected while stuck>
```

### Tier 3 → Gap spec
```
### Gap: <scenario>
What's missing:     <the rescue mechanism that does not exist>
Impact if hit:      <blast radius, data/money at risk, frequency estimate>
Who can act today:  <e.g. only a DBA with prod write access>
What should exist:   <new API / endpoint / admin UI action / hosted-service job>
Suggested owner:    <team / epic to carry it>
```

### Summary table (top of file)
```
| Flow | Entity | Stuck state | Tier | Artifact |
|------|--------|-------------|------|----------|
```

---

## Step 6: Present to the developer

Summarize: mode used, flows reviewed, scenario count per tier, the count of Tier 3 gaps (the important number), and the path to the generated file. Offer to open issues for Tier 3 gaps if the developer wants a backlog.

## Red Flags — STOP
- Classifying a scenario Tier 2 when the "trigger" only works after a manual DB edit → it is **Tier 3**.
- Leaving the repo in Mode A to audit a dependency's internals → out of scope; review only how THIS service reacts.
- Skipping the Step 2 confirmation dialogue → you may be analysing the wrong flow model.
- Trusting the scanner's `resilience` flags as ground truth → they are heuristic; a `true` is a hint and a `false` is a prompt to verify, never a final verdict.
- Starting the analysis in Mode A without the `scan-integration-points.mjs` JSON when Node.js is available → run the mechanical phase first, then reason over its output.
- **Scanning only the API project in a multi-project .NET solution and trusting a `0` result** → the boundaries live in the `Infrastructure`/`Adapters`/`Messaging` projects; an API-only scan is a false 0. Run from the solution root and never treat a `warnings[]` scope alert as "no boundaries exist".
- **Assuming K8s self-heals a business flow** → probes recycle pods, they do not unwind a half-committed transaction. A recycled pod on AKS can leave the same stuck row a VPS deploy would.
- Reporting only Tier 3 counts without the concrete "what should exist" → a gap without a spec is not actionable.

## Common Mistakes
- **Analysing happy path only.** The whole point is the stuck intermediate states, not the terminal success.
- **Treating a DLQ as Tier 1 automatically.** A DLQ with no replay path is really a Tier 2 (needs a re-drive) or Tier 3 (nothing drains it).
- **Mode B scope creep.** In plan-context mode, read the plan and epic artifacts — do not fall back into full-repo exploration.
